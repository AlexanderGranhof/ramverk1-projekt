<h1>About</h1>

<p>This webpage is a part of a <a target="_BLANK" href="https://www.bth.se/utbildning/program/pagwe20h/">web developer course</a> at <a target="_BLANK" href="https://www.bth.se/">Blekinge Tekniska Högskola.</a> The goal of this assignment is to create a reddit/stackoverflow clone with our own theme. I chose to use the food theme mixed with the stackoverflow name; FoodFlow.</p>
<p>The core purpose of this webpage is a question, comments and aswers about cooking and food in general. The webpage is built using PHP and the <a target="_BLANK" href="https://github.com/canax">canax framework</a>, a simplified framework built by the program's teachers.</p>
